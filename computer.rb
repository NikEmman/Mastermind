    # attempt to create Peter Swaszek's strategy

    # create array of all possible guesses 1111 to 6666

    # first guess is 1122, then look at the feedback

    # then compare all other possible guesses to the 1122, and remove 
    # all that wouldn't provide this feedback.

    # then pick the next number in the array and do the same. Should give a win in 5 moves
